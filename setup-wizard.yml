      **DANGER**: Some actions such as **nuke**, **compact** and **repair-reserve** are destructive actions. If the process is stopped for any reason, the localstore may become corrupted. It is recommended that you [backup](http://my.dappnode/packages/my/swarm.public.dappnode.eth/backup) first.

      - **none**: Do nothing. Start the bee node by default.

      - **nuke**: Enabling this will nuke your localstore database. Bee will resync all data next time it boots up.

      - **compact**: Compacts the localstore sharky store. Compaction is a destructive process. If the process is stopped for any reason, the localstore may become corrupted.

      - **repair-reserve**: Repairs the reserve by resetting the binIDs and removes dangling entries. This is a destructive process. If the process is stopped for any reason, the reserve may become corrupted.

      - **info**: Prints the different indexes present in the Database.

      - **validate**: Validates the localstore sharky store.

      - **validate-pin**: Validates pin collection chunks with sharky store.
